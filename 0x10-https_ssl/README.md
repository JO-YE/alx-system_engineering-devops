## General
- What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles
- What is the purpose encrypting traffic
- What SSL termination means

1. Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ dig www.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.holberton.online.   87  IN  A   54.210.47.110
sylvain@ubuntu$ dig lb-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
lb-01.holberton.online. 101 IN  A   54.210.47.110
sylvain@ubuntu$ dig web-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
web-01.holberton.online. 212    IN  A   34.198.248.145
sylvain@ubuntu$ dig web-02.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
;; ANSWER SECTION:
web-02.holberton.online. 298    IN  A   54.89.38.100
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online
The subdomain www is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
The subdomain lb-01 is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
The subdomain web-01 is a A record and points to 34.198.248.145
The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online web-02
The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
sylvain@ubuntu$
```

2. “Terminating SSL on HAproxy” means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.
- Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www.

```
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI https://www.holberton.online
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2017 01:52:04 GMT

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl https://www.holberton.online

sylvain@ubuntu$
```

3. A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
```
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sIL http://www.holberton.online
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Content-length: 0
Location: https://www.holberton.online/
Connection: close
